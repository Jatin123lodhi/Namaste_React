  ...will produce 
  
  <div>
    <ul>
        <li></li>

What is async and defer ? 
async and defer are boolean attributes which
are used with script tags which are used to load 
the external scripts efficeintly into ourweb page

when you load a web page then two major things
happens in the browser

1.html parsing
2.loading of the script,  it has two parts
(fetching the script from the n/w ) and
(executing the script line by line)


normal script tag - 
 html parsing, loading script, exe scrpit, html par

async script tag -
 html parsing with loading script , exe script,html p
defer script tag -
 html parsing with loading script , html , scrpi exe

when to use what - 
the async attribute does not gaurante the order of
execution of the script but defer does

like there are multiple scripts depenedent on each
other, so we should use defer

if we have some script like google analytic 
which is generally independent of any other sciprt
in that case we should use async
